In hereditary spherocytosis, the red blood cells are smaller and more dense, which leads to an increase in the MCHC value.

This substitution leads to the formation of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S. Under certain conditions, hemoglobin S molecules can stick together and form long, rigid rods, causing red blood cells to assume a sickle shape.
